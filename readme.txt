There comes a time when you need more flexibility than the standard WP gallery offers, That's when this plugin steps in. This plugin's goal is to make it easy to create a gallery and place it wherever you need.

1. CSS and JS are only loaded on pages where needed
1. Images link to larger versions (can be turned off)
